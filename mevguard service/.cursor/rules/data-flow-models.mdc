description: Defines data flow patterns between MEV detection, order flow control, and transaction protection components including builder/relay interactions

# data-flow-models

Key data flows between major system components:

1. MEV Detection -> Order Flow Control
- Detection engine sends MEV threat classifications (sandwich, frontrun, backrun)
- Transaction risk scores and confidence metrics flow to order routing
- Attack pattern signatures trigger protection strategy selection
- Real-time profit estimates inform routing decisions
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Order Flow Control -> Transaction Protection
- Protection strategies (private relay, timing delays) flow to execution layer
- Bundle construction parameters for sandwich protection
- Gas price optimization targets for frontrunning defense
- Relay selection criteria based on builder reputation
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Builder/Relay Integration Flow
- Builder performance metrics inform relay selection
- Real-time block space pricing feeds protection strategies
- Relay reputation scores influence routing decisions
- Block inclusion probability estimates guide timing
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Cross-Component Monitoring
- Protection success rates flow back to strategy selection
- Builder behavior patterns update reputation scores
- Network congestion metrics adjust gas strategies
- Threat detection accuracy feeds ML model updates
Importance Score: 80/100

Core Data Models:
- MEVThreat: attack type, severity, confidence score
- ProtectionStrategy: relay selection, timing, gas params
- BuilderProfile: performance history, reliability metrics
- NetworkState: congestion, gas prices, block space

Data flow optimization focuses on sub-100ms latency between detection and protection activation to ensure effective MEV defense.
