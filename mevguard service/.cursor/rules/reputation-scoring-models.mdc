## Builder Reputation Scoring

Key scoring components for assessing block builder reliability and performance:

1. Success Rate Analysis
- Block proposal acceptance tracking
- Late/missed block penalties
- Inclusion rate of user transactions
- MEV profit sharing compliance
- Importance Score: 90/100

2. MEV Behavior Assessment
- Sandwich attack frequency tracking
- Frontrunning pattern detection
- User transaction reordering analysis 
- Fair profit distribution validation
- Importance Score: 85/100

3. Network Performance Metrics
- Average block propagation time
- Transaction inclusion latency
- Network synchronization efficiency
- Cross-relay performance comparison
- Importance Score: 80/100

## MEV Bot Classification

Classification system for identifying and categorizing MEV bot behaviors:

1. Strategy Recognition
- Sandwich attack patterns
- Arbitrage sequences
- Liquidation targeting
- Flash loan combinations
- Importance Score: 95/100

2. Profit Analysis
- Per-strategy profit calculation
- Impact on user transactions
- Network fee contribution
- Value extraction patterns
- Importance Score: 90/100

## Relay Performance Tracking

Monitoring system for relay effectiveness and reliability:

1. Reliability Metrics
- Block propagation success rate
- Transaction inclusion time
- Builder connection stability
- Network synchronization speed
- Importance Score: 85/100

2. Builder Integration
- Active builder count
- Builder rotation patterns
- Payment verification tracking
- Performance consistency scoring
- Importance Score: 80/100
