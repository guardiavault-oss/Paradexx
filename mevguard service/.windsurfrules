## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The unified mempool system implements specialized blockchain transaction monitoring and MEV protection through several core components:

## Core Protection System

The quantum-mempool detection system provides advanced threat detection and analysis:

- Advanced quantum attack detection with ML/statistical analysis
- Multi-model detection covering Shor's algorithm, Grover's search, hybrid attacks
- Transaction pattern analysis with R-value verification
- Systematic address targeting detection
- Enterprise compliance tracking across multiple frameworks

Main components reside in:
`unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/quantum-mempool/src/detection/`

## MEV Protection Engine

Specialized MEV protection logic implements:

- Real-time sandwich attack detection
- Cross-chain arbitrage monitoring
- Flash loan pattern recognition
- Custom profit estimation algorithms
- Private mempool routing
- Dynamic gas optimization

Core implementation in:
`unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/mempool-core/`

## Transaction Analysis System

Advanced transaction monitoring provides:

- Multi-chain mempool analysis
- Quantum-resistant security checks
- MEV opportunity detection
- Risk scoring and threat classification
- Protection strategy selection
- Cross-chain correlation

Located in:
`unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/realtime-monitor/`

## Protection Metrics

Specialized monitoring tracks:
- MEV attack detection rates
- Protection success metrics
- Value protected calculations
- Threat intelligence gathering
- Network-specific protection status
- Cross-chain protection coordination
