# Netlify redirects file
# This file is automatically copied to dist/public during build
# Netlify reads this file to configure redirects
# IMPORTANT: Netlify processes _redirects AFTER checking for physical files
# So assets (CSS, JS) are served directly with correct MIME types

# API requests go to Railway backend
/api/* https://guardiavault-production.up.railway.app/api/:splat 200

# CRITICAL: Explicitly serve assets with 404 if not found (don't fallback to index.html)
# This ensures missing assets return 404, not HTML
/assets/* /assets/:splat 404

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all non-file and non-asset requests
# Netlify automatically serves files with extensions (css, js, png, etc.) before this redirect
# This ensures assets are served with correct MIME types
/* /index.html 200
