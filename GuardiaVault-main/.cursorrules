## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Architecture

The system implements a digital inheritance platform with four primary business domains:

### Death Verification Engine
Controls multi-source death verification with weighted confidence scoring:
- Death certificates (100% weight)
- Official records (80% weight)
- Obituaries (70% weight)
- Requires minimum 70% confidence across 2+ sources
- Protection against false triggers through consensus

### Guardian Secret Distribution
Manages crypto inheritance through secure fragmentation:
- Implements 3-of-5 Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Guardian-specific passphrase generation
- Fragment verification system
- Master secret management protocols

### Asset Protection System
Implements dead man's switch mechanics:
- Check-in verification requirements
- Configurable grace periods
- Warning state management
- Vault activation countdown
- Status transition controls

### Multi-Party Verification
Controls inheritance execution through guardian consensus:
- M-of-N guardian approval model
- Role-based guardian permissions
- Fragment verification tracking
- Guardian replacement protocols

## Business Rules Integration

The platform enforces critical inheritance rules through:
- Multiple official source requirements for death confirmation
- Mandatory waiting periods before asset release
- Minimum guardian validation thresholds
- Multi-source fraud prevention consensus
- Time-locked smart contract execution

Based on the specification provided, this codebase consists primarily of UI component implementations without significant business logic:

1. Component Architecture
- Generic UI primitives built on Radix UI
- Styling implemented through Tailwind CSS
- Standard presentational components (buttons, cards, dialogs)
- Layout and interaction patterns
- Accessibility attributes and handlers

2. Visual Components
- Interactive animations (NebulaShader)
- Presentational styling
- Event handling for user interactions

This codebase contains no notable business logic components or domain-specific implementations. The architecture focuses entirely on reusable UI elements and visual presentation.

Core files are presentational in nature and contain:
- Component definitions
- Style configurations
- Event handlers
- Layout structure
- Animation effects

No business rules, data processing, or domain-specific algorithms are present in these UI components.
