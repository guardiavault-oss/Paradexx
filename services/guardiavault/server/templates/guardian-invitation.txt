GuardiaVault - You've Been Named as a Guardian

Hello,

{{ownerName}} has designated you as a trusted guardian for their vault: {{vaultName}}

YOUR ROLE AS GUARDIAN
----------------------
You will securely hold an encrypted key fragment. This fragment alone cannot access the vault - it requires collaboration with other guardians. The vault uses a 2-of-3 threshold system, meaning 2 out of 3 guardians must provide their fragments to unlock the vault.

SECURITY MEASURES
-----------------
• Your fragment is encrypted with a unique passphrase
• Zero-knowledge architecture - GuardiaVault never sees the data
• Multi-party verification required for vault access
• End-to-end encryption throughout the process
