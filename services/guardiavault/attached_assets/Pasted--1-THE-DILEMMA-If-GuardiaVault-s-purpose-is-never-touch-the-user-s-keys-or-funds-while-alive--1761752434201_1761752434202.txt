🧩 1. THE DILEMMA

If GuardiaVault’s purpose is “never touch the user’s keys or funds while alive”,
then auto-withdrawals directly violate that — unless you design a trust-minimized autopayment vault that works on-chain under cryptographic conditions.

You have two conflicting goals:

Reliability: Subscriptions keep running even if user is gone.

Sovereignty: Platform must never have spending control over user assets.

You can’t just pull funds like Netflix does, because you don’t own custody.
So we need to innovate.

🧠 2. SMART APPROACHES TO CRYPTO SUBSCRIPTIONS

Here are your four realistic models, from most decentralized to most convenient:

(A) Streamed Subscription via Superfluid / Sablier (Ideal for Web3-native)

💡 Concept:
The user “streams” a small continuous payment (like 0.0001 ETH/minute) to your platform.
If they stop streaming (voluntarily or by death), the vault eventually pauses the inheritance system but doesn’t instantly lock or cancel.

Tech Stack:

Superfluid or Sablier protocol

Stablecoin (DAI/USDC) payment flow

Smart contract auto-pauses if stream stops for 30+ days

Pros:

Fully non-custodial

Transparent, automated

Keeps working even if user’s wallet is inactive

Cons:

Requires user setup (not familiar to normies)

Needs constant token balance to keep streaming

(B) Prepaid Time-Locked Subscription (Best for “Dead Man’s Switch” logic)

💡 Concept:
When a user sets up their vault, they deposit X months of subscription upfront into a time-locked payment contract.
The system unlocks payments to GuardiaVault month-by-month automatically.

If they die, the subscription keeps paying for the next N months.
If they cancel, they can claw back unused balance.

Tech Stack:

SubscriptionEscrow.sol contract

ETH or stablecoin deposits

Chainlink Keepers or Gelato automation to release payments

Pros:

Non-custodial but reliable

Predictable revenue stream

Works even if the user disappears

Cons:

Requires upfront payment

Needs automated upkeep service

(C) Delegated “Allowance” Subscription (Least ideal but simplest)

💡 Concept:
User approves GuardiaVault contract to withdraw small amounts monthly (ERC20.approve() + transferFrom() flow).
If they pass away, it still works until their wallet runs out.

Pros:

Familiar pattern (like token subscriptions)

Easy UX

Cons:

Custody risk (you technically can drain approved funds)

Not philosophically aligned with a zero-trust vault

(D) Off-chain Fiat Gateway (For normies and hybrid users)

💡 Concept:
Stripe/PayPal/Coinbase Commerce billing for users who prefer card or CEX auto-debits.
Has failover to on-chain payments for advanced users.

Pros:

Easy for mainstream adoption

Predictable cashflow

Cons:

Centralized

Breaks continuity if user dies (since card expires or is frozen)

🔐 3. THE IDEAL HYBRID (REALISTIC $100M MODEL)

Here’s the perfect synthesis:

Layer	Function	Tech
On-chain	SubscriptionEscrow.sol (handles prepaid or streaming logic)	Solidity + Chainlink Keepers
Backend	Monitors expired streams, triggers renewal notices	Node/FastAPI
Off-chain	Stripe/FIAT gateway fallback for normies	Stripe + Coinbase Commerce
Emergency Override	Death detected → lock future payments, retain service for X months	Smart contract flag + backend event

This way:

Crypto-native users stay 100% on-chain and autonomous.

Traditional users can still pay with a card.

Subscriptions don’t break when someone dies, but can gracefully taper off after their vault is successfully transferred.

⚰️ 4. INHERITANCE & BILLING LOGIC TOGETHER

💀 When death is confirmed:

Payment contract auto-extends 6 months from last payment date (to cover guardian costs + finalization).

After that, the vault is archived, and recurring billing stops automatically.

💡 My Recommendation

Use Hybrid B + A:

Prepaid subscription escrow + optional continuous payment stream
This combo gives:

On-chain automation

Death resilience

Zero custody risk

Predictable business model

So your users fund 12 months upfront, and the system drips out subscription payments monthly via Chainlink Keepers.
If they disappear, everything still works for a year — the vault remains alive long enough to complete the inheritance cycle.
