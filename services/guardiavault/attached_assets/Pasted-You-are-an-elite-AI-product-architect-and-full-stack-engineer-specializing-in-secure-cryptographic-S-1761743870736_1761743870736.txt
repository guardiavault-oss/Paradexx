You are an elite AI product architect and full-stack engineer specializing in secure cryptographic SaaS systems. I want you to design, wireframe, and produce full code blueprints for a next-generation platform called GuardiaVault — a “Dead Man’s Switch for crypto.”

🔒 CORE CONCEPT

Build a system that guarantees safe inheritance of self-custodied crypto assets when the user dies or becomes incapacitated — without ever giving up private key control while alive.

The product must solve the $200B+ problem of lost crypto due to death (Hal Finney, QuadrigaCX, Matthew Mellon, etc.).

⚙️ TECHNICAL INNOVATION

Combine four cryptographic primitives into one protocol:

Shamir Secret Sharing – split private keys into 5 fragments (3-of-5 needed to recover)

Time-Locked Encryption – fragments only decrypt after a missed check-in period + attested death

Zero-Knowledge Death Verification – verify death using proofs (NFT death certificates, attestor consensus, or legal orders) without revealing identity

Dead Man’s Switch – requires user check-ins every X days, or inheritance process begins automatically

💻 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

3 user roles:

User (Owner) – configures check-ins, beneficiaries, guardians, and attestors

Guardians – hold encrypted key fragments; cannot read until time-lock expires

Attestors – confirm death using verifiable proofs

3 phases of operation:

Setup: User defines beneficiaries, guardians, attestors, and time periods

Alive: Periodic check-ins (every 90 days via wallet + biometric)

Death: After missed check-in + confirmed death → fragments decrypt → beneficiaries notified

🔐 SECURITY PRINCIPLES

Zero-custody architecture (platform never has access to private keys)

On-chain timestamp registry for check-ins

Encrypted fragment distribution to guardians

Proof-of-death smart contract oracle (NFT or signed multisig)

Emergency override if falsely triggered

Progressive inheritance release (10% now, 30% in 1yr, 60% in 2yrs)

🧠 BUILD REQUIREMENTS

Create a complete MVP spec (backend, frontend, and contract layers) that includes:

Smart Contracts (Solidity 0.8+)

CheckInRegistry.sol — logs user check-ins, timestamps, and expiration logic

FragmentMap.sol — maps guardians to encrypted fragment metadata

VerificationOracle.sol — verifies death proofs via attestors or NFTs

Backend (Node.js + TypeScript or FastAPI)

Wallet authentication via signature

Shamir key fragmentation / recombination module

Time-lock encryption with timelock.dev or AGE encryption

Redis + PostgreSQL for state tracking

Email/SMS notification queue (SendGrid + Twilio)

API endpoints for setup, check-ins, and proof submission

Frontend (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

Onboarding wizard (Wallet → Guardians → Beneficiaries → Attestors → Timing)

“I’m Alive” check-in button (biometric + wallet signature)

Guardian dashboard for accepting roles and holding encrypted fragments

Beneficiary dashboard for inheritance claim process

Mobile (React Native + Expo)

Push notifications for check-ins

Local secure fragment storage

Biometric validation

Crypto Stack

Use SLIP39 for key splitting

Use SnarkJS for ZK proofs

Use ethers.js for wallet ops

Use OpenZeppelin libraries for secure contracts

🌍 INFRASTRUCTURE

AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) with Cloudflare CDN

GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Datadog + Elastic for monitoring/logging

SOC2-compliant data architecture

Full encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256 / TLS1.3)

💸 BUSINESS LOGIC

Pricing Tiers:

Basic: $99/yr → 1 wallet

Pro: $299/yr → 5 wallets, advanced controls

Family: $599/yr → unlimited wallets, lawyer support

Enterprise: $5K+/yr → API integration

Revenue Streams: Subscription SaaS, enterprise API, legal partner commissions, yield on dormant assets

🧭 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Think like Apple meets Chainlink: futuristic, elegant, trustworthy.
UI should feel like a vault control center with minimal cognitive load.
Use glowing “lifeline” visual for check-ins and countdowns.

🔥 DELIVERABLES

Full MVP architecture map (contracts + backend + frontend + mobile)
