## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Business Components:

1. Digital Asset Inheritance System
- Tracks lost cryptocurrency statistics ($3.8B in lost assets)
- 2-of-3 guardian threshold recovery system
- Biometric proof-of-life verification
- Encrypted key fragment distribution
- Multi-source death verification with consensus system

2. Guardian Management 
- Multi-party verification workflow for vault access
- Time-locked recovery process (7 days)
- Guardian allocation limits per tier (3-unlimited)
- Role-based permissions with status transitions
- HMAC-based invitation system

3. Smart Will System
- Percentage-based asset allocation
- NFT-specific inheritance rules
- Charity DAO integration
- Multiple trigger conditions:
  - Time-based deadman switch
  - Death oracle verification
  - Guardian consensus
  - Manual execution

4. Yield Generation
- Protocol-agnostic yield strategies
- Integration with Lido, Aave, Compound
- Performance fee calculation (1%)
- Principal protection mechanisms
- Auto-compound with inheritance protection

5. Recovery System
- 2-of-3 and 3-of-5 recovery schemes
- Multi-stage attestation workflow
- Encrypted fragment distribution
- Recovery fee structure (10-20%)
- Grace period management
- Emergency revocation mechanism

Key Business Workflows:
1. Death Verification Pipeline
- Government records integration
- Obituary monitoring
- Certificate validation
- Consensus-based triggering
- Fraud prevention checks

2. Recovery Process
- Guardian attestation collection
- Time-lock enforcement
- Multi-signature verification
- Key fragment reconstruction
- Asset distribution execution

The system implements a comprehensive digital inheritance platform combining guardian-based recovery, biometric verification, and automated inheritance triggers with yield generation capabilities.
