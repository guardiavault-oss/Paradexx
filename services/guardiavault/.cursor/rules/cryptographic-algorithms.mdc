## Secret Sharing Implementation
Core cryptographic logic for distributing recovery phrases:

1. Shamir's Secret Sharing (Importance: 95/100)
- Implements 2-of-3 threshold scheme for passphrase fragments
- Guardian-specific fragment generation using:
  - PBKDF2 key derivation
  - Fragment index + guardian email as salt
  - 100k iteration rounds for key stretching
- Zero-knowledge architecture preventing server-side storage

2. Fragment Distribution Protocol (Importance: 90/100)
- Secure passphrase generation per guardian:
  - Unique fragment derivation
  - Guardian-specific verification
  - Multi-step distribution workflow
- Fragment reconstruction validation
- Guardian consensus requirements

3. Vault Recovery Mechanism (Importance: 85/100)
- Fragment recombination protocol
- Multi-party verification system
- Guardian attestation requirements:
  - Minimum 2 valid fragments (2-of-3 threshold)
  - Time-locked progressive access
  - Consensus validation

4. Fragment Protection (Importance: 80/100)
- Encrypted fragment storage
- Guardian-specific access controls
- Fragment redistribution logic
- Replacement protocol for guardian changes

Core vault security is maintained through the combination of Shamir's Secret Sharing and multi-guardian consensus requirements, ensuring no single party can access protected assets without proper verification and fragment reconstruction.
