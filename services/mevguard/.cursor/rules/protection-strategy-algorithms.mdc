## Core Protection Strategies

### Risk Assessment Engine
Path: unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/quantum-mempool/src/detection/risk_engine.py

Risk scoring system utilizing:
- Transaction pattern analysis with ML models
- Address relationship mapping
- Historical threat correlation
- Network-specific risk factors
- Cross-chain behavior analysis
Importance Score: 95/100

### Protection Level Assignment
Path: unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/quantum-mempool/src/protection/level_manager.py

Protection tier determination based on:
- Transaction value thresholds
- Contract interaction complexity
- Address risk scoring
- Network congestion state
- MEV opportunity presence
Importance Score: 90/100

### Strategy Selection Logic
Path: unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/quantum-mempool/src/protection/strategy_selector.py

Protection strategy implementation:
- Private mempool routing for high-risk transactions
- Gas price optimization for medium risk
- Transaction timing adjustments for low risk
- Multi-relay coordination for critical protection
Importance Score: 85/100

### MEV-specific Protection
Path: unified-mempool-system/src/unified_mempool/quantum-mempool/src/protection/mev_shield.py

MEV attack mitigation through:
- Sandwich attack prevention
- Frontrunning protection
- Flashloan attack detection
- Arbitrage opportunity monitoring
Importance Score: 90/100

## Protection Implementation Workflows

1. Initial Risk Assessment
- Transaction analysis
- Address profiling
- Smart contract scanning
- Network state evaluation

2. Strategy Selection
- Protection level determination
- Resource allocation
- Relay selection
- Gas strategy optimization

3. Protection Execution
- Strategy deployment
- Real-time monitoring
- Protection verification
- Success measurement

Key Business Rules:
- High-value transactions always receive maximum protection
- Critical contracts require multi-relay protection
- Network congestion triggers enhanced protection
- MEV risk increases protection level
- Cross-chain transactions require coordinated protection
